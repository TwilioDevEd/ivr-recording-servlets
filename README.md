# IVR Call Recording and Agent Conference. Level: Intermediate. Powered by Twilio - Java | Servlets

An example application implementing an automated phone line using
Twilio and Java Servlets.

[Read the full tutorial here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials/walkthrough/ivr-screening/java/servlets)!

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TwilioDevEd/ivr-recording-servlets.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/TwilioDevEd/ivr-recording-servlets)

## Run the application

1. Clone the repository and `cd` into it.
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:TwilioDevEd/ivr-recording-servlets.git
    cd ivr-recording-servlets
    ```

1. Create the database.

    ```bash
    $ createdb ivr-recording

    ```
  _The application uses PostgreSQL as the persistence layer. If you
  don't have it already, you should install it. The easiest way is by
  using [Postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com/)._

1. Edit the sample configuration file `.environment` to match your database configuration:
    ```
    export DB_USERNAME=your_db_username
    export DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
    export JDBC_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/ivr-recording
    ```

  Once you have edited the `.environment` file, if you are using a UNIX operating system,
  just use the `source` command to load the variables into your environment:

  ```bash
  $ source .environment
  ```

  _If you are using a different operating system, make sure that all the
  variables from the `.environment` file are loaded into your environment._

1. Execute the migrations.
    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew flywayMigrate
    ```

1. Run the application.
    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew jettyRun
    ```

1. Expose the application to the wider Internet using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)

    ```
    ngrok http 8080 -host-header="localhost:8080"
    ```

5. Provision a number under the
   [Manage Numbers page](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/incoming)
   on your account. Set the voice URL for the number to
   `http://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok.io/ivr/welcome`.

That's it!
